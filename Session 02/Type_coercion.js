//Type coercion in js

// Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another 
// (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert 
// values from one data type to another with one key difference â€” type coercion is implicit whereas 
// type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.

const value1 = "5";
const value2 = 9;
let sum = value1 + value2;
console.log(sum);

// In the above example, JavaScript has coerced the 9 from a number into a string and then concatenated 
// the two values together, resulting in a string of 59. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a 
// number and decided to use a string.
// The compiler could have coerced the 5 into a number and returned a sum of 14, but it did not. 
// To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the 5 to a number using the Number() method:

sum = Number(value1) + value2;
